Since the csv files are still being written to in that folder (the program is
running right?) that's why I copied the csvs to some other folder before opening them

Remember, this are incomplete csvs, the complete csv would be obtained after the
program has completed, that is when this screen stops changing.

The output is only 3 columns, 
Address | Response Code | Description

Invalid URL: billingwithhttps.com in file: C:\Users\priyank\Documents\Visual Studio 2012\Projects\broken-links-extractor\500k quantcast links for priyank to crawl and find broken links - 2 links deep.txt
I think this is self explanatory?

think so,, you mean the exacmple of billingwith?  
yeah, it means the input specified is wrong,
it should always be of the form
http://domain.com

Anyway, that is not much to worry about

In the B column if you specify a filter, your work is done

You familiar with the filter concept?

yes, and about the input file, do the domains need to be in any specific format like 
http, www., 

etcN?O


YOUR SHIFT IS ON?

um

okay

Nope. No specific format. except that it should start with
http://
or https://

ok

404 means page not found, so you can use those domains

1000 means your output, they are the ones which definitely are not registered

that's it as demo

you wanna look around?

sure do, and s0o 404 means tno site was found baically?

yeah, let me give you an example

So it's up to you to decide whether this can be used for domain registration or not?
I think you have more knowledge than me in that field

ok wonderful, how are you sure that error 1000 means "not registered"?

because the DNS cannot be resolved for those, and error 1000 is something which
I chose at random, it's not a normal web error code, it's my custom code.

So whenever you visit a url with code 1000, the browser could not resolve dns
and that means the domain is not registered

lets see an Example

I think you might know a site where you can check whether the domain is available 
for registration?

um I can look haha, well whatever, a asljdf;oaief.com wont be available.  I get ur 
idea, very nice priyank.

Does this bot satisfy the requirements we previously agreed upon?

I bet it does

:), my big objective would have been speed and consistency, so if you think its
got that pretty well, then great.

HAHA SEE AIN"T FAILED YET< SO YEAH IT"S ALL OPTIMIZED< SPEED AND LESS MEMORY AS WELL
PLUS MINE IS TWO GB OF RAM ONLY< SO ON YOUR PC IT WOULD BE MORE FASTER

o very nice.  ya id like to just take a peak to see how many its done so far.  The
