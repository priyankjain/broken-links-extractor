HI, so this is the exe

the first dropdown on the left you specify the depth
the second dropdown on top left you specify number of depths

the first button on top right you specify the input file containing urls. You can
specify multiple input files and while running if you need to add more urls, just
make a new input file somewhere on your computer containing the new urls and add the
file through this button :)

The second button on the top right will start the program

Speed means number of threads

There are two output files generated: logfile.csv and broken_links.csv

logfile.csv is the log of the entir program, it contains status of each url, the
response code and error message returned

broken_links.csv contains only the urls which din't return an ok response

In short. logfile.csv contains both failed plus succeeded urls and broken_links.csv
contains only failed urls. So broken_links.csv is the file which contains your
desired output.
