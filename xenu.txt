http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html This is what I've been using, but it "runs out of memory" and freezes, its useless. It will crawl a site and grab all the external links on the page, and even search many pages deep within the site for external pages. The idea is to search for domains that may be available for registration. Then I can buy and register it. But instead of just crawling 1 site, it will crawl tons of sites at once, 1-100 threads and finds tons.
